        <h1>Foundations Reflection</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>I’m a reflective person and need time alone to process information, come up with new strategies and problem solve
                <li>The importance of neuroplasticity, using repetition to help learning, and coding every day to make it stick
                <li>Growth mindset – the idea that intelligence can be developed. A person with a growth mindset tends to embrace challenges, persists in the face of setback, sees effort as the path to mastery, learns from criticism, and finds lessons and inspiration in the success of others. As a result, they reach ever higher levels of achievement.
            </ol>
            <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Useability – making websites/apps etc more intuitive by being aware of the users needs, empathising with them  
                <li>Working together with others – better communication leads to better results
                <li>Building connections with teammates
                <li>Learning from each other
                </ul>    
            <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
                <p>Great to refresh learning strategies, learn more about learning 
            <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
                <ul>    
                    <li>Publishing online – I'm generally a reasonably private person so don’t enjoy sharing online
                    <li>Overthinking my answers
                </ul>
            <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
                <ul>    
                    <li>Teaching interpersonal skills good for any workplace
                    <li>Industry looks for these skills
                    <li>Can teach programming, difficult to teach how to work well with others, reflect on yourself
                </ul>    
            <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead?</h2>
                <p>No, it has been useful to reflect, build skills to make more employable
