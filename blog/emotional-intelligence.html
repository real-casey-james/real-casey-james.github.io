        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>What is Emotional Intelligence? </h2>

            <p>Being in touch with your emotions, the ability to distinguish between different emotions and label them appropriately, and being able to recognise the emotions of others around you.  
                
            <h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>
                
            <p>IQ is a measure of ‘intelligence’ ie ‘how smart you are’. There is some debate about the effectiveness of IQ as a measure of intelligence, but the general thinking is that your IQ is set when you’re born, whereas EQ can be learnt and built upon. Research suggests EQ is a much greater indicator of happiness and success than IQ is. 

            <h2>Why is it important?</h2>

            <p>The ability to recognise your own emotions helps you to guide your behaviour in all situations in life – eg recognising when you need a few minutes time out. 
                The ability to recognise other peoples emotions helps in the way you interact with them, and leads to stronger relationships and better social dynamics.
