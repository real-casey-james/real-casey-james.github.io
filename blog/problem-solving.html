                <h3>Got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
                <p>
                    On my profile page for freecodecamp I wanted to have/had to have project tiles for each of the 4 projects I had worked on. In a previous task I had written code for 3 flexboxes in a flex container, so I just cut and paste it over and edited it. I added in the 4th project, but was really struggling to get the 4th box in the container. It didn't inherit any of the css I gave the other boxes, and just hung below the other 3 boxes, overflowing into another section. I re-read the code, Googled around, read some guides, and just kept on hitting a brick wall. I opened the offending page in Chrome and used the developer features to poke around and see what was happening. The 4th box was clearly not in the container, so I re-read my code for like the 10th time and realised I hadn't shifted the closing /div tag for the container from the end of the 3rd box to the end of the 4th. That bloody /div tag wasted so much of my time, such a rookie error, but hey, it all worked out fine in the end. I'd like to say I won't make the same mistake again but I probably will.
                </p>
                <h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way</h3>
                <p>
                    For the product landing page project on freecodecamp, I thought it would be funny to make a page about spoons. I found this shitty cartoon image of a grumpy spoon to be the logo for the company, but the background of the logo was white, and looked jarring and ugly against my hotPink background. I was just gonna leave it, as I didn't think it was that big of a deal, and thought trying to alpha out the white would be a massive mish in html/css. Out of curiosity though I had a Google around, and found I could solve my problem with a single line of code - mix-blend-mode: multiply;  It looks like it’s telling the computer how to handle blending the layers of html together, but I don't fully understand what it’s doing, or what other applications it might have. It's on my list to look more in to when I have time
                </p> 
                <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>
                <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
                <p>    
                    Writing code in plain English first helps me to break down the problem into easier to manage chunks. This is particularly useful when the problem is complex, to break it down into smaller, easier to solve pieces. It’s also useful when I immediately know how to solve a part of a challenge, but need time to think about the other parts – I can quickly jot down the parts of the challenge, solve the easier parts, and spend more time on the others.
                </p>    
                <h3>Trying something</h3>
                <p>    
                    I have got to a point in my learning and confidence that I am happy to just throw something in and see if it works. Even if it doesn’t work, it might show some useful error messages, or maybe it will partly solve the problem, and just needs a few tweaks to get it working properly. 
                </p>    
                <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
                <p>    
                    There have often been times when I have been stuck on a problem, and re-reading my code line by line, while explaining what it is meant to do to an inanimate object, has helped me to identify the problem areas.
                </p>    
                <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
                <p>    
                    I have found many error messages to be confusing and unhelpful, but as I learn more about coding, these messages are becoming more and more useful.
                </p>    
                <h3>Console.logging</h3>
                <p>    
                    I have often found my code doesn’t work, and as it gets more and more complex, it becomes more and more useful to know where in my code it is failing. Console logging helps with this, to follow the logic of the code, see what parts are working as expected, and identifying those that don’t.
                </p>    
                <h3>Googling</h3>
                <p>    
                    Google has all the answers, but I do try to use it as a last resort, and not rely on it too much. I’ll try to solve a problem using other methods before resorting to Google – but it is very useful!
                </p>    
                <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
                <p>    
                    I haven’t come across a problem yet that I haven’t been able to solve using other methods, but will definitely ask others if these methods fail. 
                </p>    
                <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
                <p>    
                    I haven’t come across a problem yet that I haven’t been able to solve using other methods, but will definitely ask others if these methods fail. 
                </p>    
                <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
                <p>    
                    I am a very reflective person in general, so I find this useful. If I am stuck on a problem I might do something else for a while, like go for a walk or do some chores, and often in the process of reflecting about the problem I come up with a potential solution. This also happens when I try to get to sleep, which isn’t always the best!
