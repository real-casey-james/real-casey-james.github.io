                <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>     
                <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
                <p>
                    Understanding how their brain stores and recalls information helps people engage with strategies to help their learning.  Through learning about neuroplasticity, people may be able to figure out how to ‘rewire’ their brains.
                </p>
                <h3>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
                <p>
                    To help my own learning – by using repetition and doing similar tasks to build connections between brain cells. 
                </p>
                <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lots of practice
                    <li>Repetition
                    <li>Doing things over and over again
                    <li>Traveling to new environments
                    <li>Using mnemonic devices
                    <li>Reading fiction
                    <li>Expanding vocabulary
                    <li>Sleeping!
                </ul>

                <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
                <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
                <p>
                    Growth mindset is the belief that intelligence can be developed, as opposed to a fixed mindset, that intelligence is static.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When a person has a growth mindset, they tend to embrace challenges, persist in the face of setback, see effort as the path to mastery, learn from criticism, and find lessons and inspiration in the success of others. As a result, they reach ever higher levels of achievement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A fixed mindset is the traditional view, which leads to a desire to look smart, and therefore has a tendancy to avoid challenges, give up easily, see effort as fruitless, ignore useful negative feedback, and feel threatened by the success of others. As a result, they may achieve less than their full potential. 
                </p>
                <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
                <p>
                    I already had knowledge of growth mindset, so the revision was useful. 
                </p>
                <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
                <p>
                    I will embrace challenges, persist in the face of setback, see effort as the path to mastery, learn from criticism, and find lessons and inspiration in the success of others.
                </p>

                <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
                <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy</h3>
                <p>
                    I will use these strategies to enhance my learning. I will enchance my coding daily, and regularly practice and revise to keep the new concepts at the front of my brain, and keep building connections between my brain cells.
