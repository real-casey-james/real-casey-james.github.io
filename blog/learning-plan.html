        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <section>
          <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>See where it takes me – start in web development and see if there’s anything else that takes my interest – in the wider programming, development, IT worlds. I’m curious about other programming languages and excited to learn more about them, when I’m a bit better with the ones I’m currently learning
          <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Strengths: I’m interested in this stuff, I feel I’m ok at it and I’m motivated to learn more. Also, I’m all in, I quit my job after being at it for 10 years so even more motivated to make this work!
              <li>Limitations: Haven’t done other relevant study so possibly at a disadvantage. I tend to get quite interested in things so have a tendency to deep dive stuff – while I’m learning I should focus on the task at hand and not try and learn everything at once!
            </ul>
          <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Not sure how I’ll be in room full of strangers
              <li>I don’t enjoy public speaking but can do it if needed
              <li>Big change after 10 years at previous work
            </ul>
          <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Reviewing my work and offering suggestions for improvement
              <li>Communicate timely, clearly, efficiently,
            </ul>
          <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
            <p>I will work with others calmly and respectfully. I will be reliable, and do what I say I’m going to do. If things are building up I’ll talk about it with those around me. I’ll take time out when I’m feeling stressed. I enjoy problem solving and trying to figure things out on my own. I rely on friends and family for support. I’ll keep good communication with classmates and facilitators.
          <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>I want to work in IT. My plan is to start in web development and see where it takes me. I’ll see where my interest is, where opportunities are, and go from there. I’m curious about other programming languages and excited to learn more about them, when I’m a bit better with the ones I’m currently learning 
          <h2>Workload Management</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>I will work with others calmly and respectfully. I will be reliable, and do what I say I’m going to do.  
              <li>If things are building up I’ll talk about it with those around me. I’ll take time out when I’m feeling stressed.
              <li>I enjoy problem solving and trying to figure things out on my own. I rely on friends and family for support. I’ll keep good communication with classmates and facilitators.
              <li>I expect us all to have fun. I expect timely and clear communication. 
              <li>I don’t have too many other commitments at the moment. I just wanna go biking and snowboarding every now and then.
