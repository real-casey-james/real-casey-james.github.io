        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Goals</h2>

            <p>I want to work in IT. My plan is to start in web development and see where it takes me. I’ll see where my interest is, where opportunities are, and go from there. I’m curious about other programming languages and excited to learn more about them, when I’m a bit better with the ones I’m currently learning 
                
                
            <h2>Workload Management</h2>
                
            <ul><li>I will work with others calmly and respectfully. I will be reliable, and do what I say I’m going to do. 
                
            <li>If things are building up I’ll talk about it with those around me. I’ll take time out when I’m feeling stressed.
                
            <li>I enjoy problem solving and trying to figure things out on my own. I rely on friends and family for support. I’ll keep good communication with classmates and facilitators.
                
            <li>I expect us all to have fun. I expect timely and clear communication. 
                
            <li>I don’t have too many other commitments at the moment. I just wanna go biking and snowboarding every now and then.</ul>
