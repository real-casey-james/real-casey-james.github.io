    <h1>CSS Positioning</h1>
    
    <section id="intro">
    <p>The <code>position</code> property in CSS specifies the positioning method used for an element.</p>

    <p>There are 6 position values:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code>static
        <li>relative
        <li>absolute
        <li>fixed
        <li>sticky
        <li>inherit</code>
    </ul>

    <p>Today we're going to look at relative, absolute and fixed positioning.

    <p>Positioning allows you to take elements out of the normal layout flow of a document, and make them behave differently. You could have an element sitting on top of another one, or have an element always remain in the same position on a users screen. 

    <p>You set which position method using the <code>position:</code> property, followed by which method you'd like to use

    <p>You set the position using <code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code> and <code>left</code> properties. It is important to note that your element will move AWAY from the property by the specified amount eg <code>top: 30px;</code> will push the element DOWN by 30px.

    <p>Positioning doesn't cascade, ie child elements will not inherit a position from their parent, unless you tell the child specifically to inherit it.

</section>

<section id="rel">
    <h2>Relative Positioning</h2>

    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>CSS elements with relative positioning are positioned relative to where they would normally be placed, ie 'relative to itself'. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element moving. 

    <h3>What's it good for?</h3>
    <ul><li>Offsetting elements
    <li>Getting elements to line up</ul>

    <h3>How can I use it?</h3>
    <ul><li><code>position: relative;</code> sets the element to have a relative position
    <li><code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code> and <code>left</code> properties are used to set the elements position, relative to where they would normally be placed</ul>

    <p>If you set the element to a relative position, and don't set any other position attributes (<code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code> or <code>left</code>), nothing will happen - the element will stay in its 'normal' position.

    <h3>Example</h3>
    <p>Here's the CSS for simple relative positioning. A container with an <code>id</code> of <code>relative</code> has a <code>position</code> of <code>relative</code>, and is positioned <code>left</code> by <code>100px</code>.</p>
    <p>The code below is <code>editable</code> - change some of the properties and values and see what happens!


        <div class="container" id="relative">
        <style spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true">
    #relative {
        position: relative;
        left: 100px;
    }
                </style>

    </div>
    


</section>


<section id="abs">
    <h2>Absolute Positioning</h2>

    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>CSS elements with absolute positioning are positioned relative to the nearest relatively (or absolutely) positioned parent. If it has no positioned parents, then it uses the document body. 

    <h3>What's it good for?</h3>
    <p>This powerful type of positioning allows you to place your element precisely where you want it.
    <p>The trade off it the element is removed from the flow of elements on the page. An element with an absolute position is not affected by other elements, and doesn't affect other elements. The element will overlap other elements unless you take action to avoid it. 
    
    <p>Overuse can limit the flexibility of your site.

    <p>It can be used for popup info boxes, control menus, rollover panels etc.

    <h3>How can I use it?</h3>
    <ul><li><code>position: absolute;</code> sets the element to have absolute positioning
    <li><code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code> and <code>left</code> properties are used to set the elements position, relative to its parent.</ul>

        
        <div class="container" id="absolute">
            <style spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true">
    #absolute {
        position: absolute;
        right: 10px;
    }
                    </style>
    
        </div>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p id="moveit">On the right is the CSS for simple absolute positioning. A container with an <code>id</code> of <code>absolute</code> has a <code>position</code> of <code>absolute</code>, and is positioned <code>right</code> by <code>10px</code>. This means it is 10 pixels away from the right side of its parent - which is this page as a whole.</p>
        <p>The code to the right is <code>editable</code> - change some of the properties and values and see what happens!
</section>

<section id="fix">
    <h2>Fixed Positioning</h2>
        
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>CSS elements with fixed positioning are similar to absolute positioning - instead of being relative to their parent, they are fixed relative to the users viewport, or screen. This means that the element stays in the same position on the users screen, even when scrolling. It doesn't leave a gap in the page where it would have been located. 

    <h3>What's it good for?</h3>
    <ul><li>A navbar you want to always remain at the top of the page, even when scrolling
    <li>A footer that is always visible, and might have copyright info, contact links, social media links etc</ul>

    <h3>How can I use it?</h3>
    <ul><li><code>position: fixed;</code> sets the element to have a fixed position
    <li><code>top</code>, <code>right</code>, <code>bottom</code> and <code>left</code> properties are used to set the elements position, relative to the users viewport/screen.</ul>
        
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>There should be a box of code in the bottom right of your screen. The code sets the container with an <code>id</code> of <code>fixed</code> to a <code>position</code> of <code>fixed</code>, and is positioned <code>right</code> by <code>0px</code> and <code>bottom</code> by <code>0px</code>, forcing it into the bottom right.</p>

        <p>The code is <code>editable</code> - change some of the properties and values and see what happens!

        <div class="container" id="fixed">
            <style spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true">
    #fixed {
        position: fixed;
        right: 0px;
        bottom: 0px;
    }
                    </style>
    
        </div>

    <h2>Practice (beta)</h2>
    <p>Edit the code below to see the effect the different properties have on the div container. Experiment with the positions discussed above, and remember measurements don't have to be in pixels! Refresh this page to reset.
    <style spellcheck="false" contenteditable="true">

            position: relative;
            top: 10px;
