        <h1>Identity & Values</h1>
        <section>
            <h2>Core Personal Values</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Family & Friends – I love spending time with people close to me 
                <li>Work hard play hard – I like to work hard and do a good job, but also take time for myself and do things I enjoy doing
                <li>Don’t take life too seriously – life’s too short to get bogged down with serious things
                <li>Do fun shit – I like being outside, being active, going to new places, doing new things. Mountain biking and snowboarding
            </ul>

            <h2>Ethical Decisions </h2>
            <p>In my previous job as a youth worker, I encountered many situations that required an ethical decision. Ethics somewhat ironically prevent me talking about anything with much detail. I needed to weigh up the importance of confidentiality and trust, vs the moral and ethical factors at play. Confidentiality can be ethical to break if there is an immediate danger to someone.

            <h2>Culture</h2>
            <p>My granddad is Austrian, making me one quarter Austrian, and three quarters ‘other’. I don’t really know what it means to be an Austrian, but I love the outdoors, bread, meat and dairy, so maybe that’s it?
            <p>I am a born and bred New Zealander, which I think makes me easy going and not too serious, love spending time with friends and family, as well as loving the outdoors, exercising, and also reading, Playstation, music etc.

            <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
            <p>A few years ago I did Gallup StrengthsFinder for work. It identifies your top 5 strengths out of a pool of 34. It’s all well and good to understand each strength, but the real power comes from knowing how your strengths interact with each other, and how you can use your strengths when working as a part of a team. You meet with a StrengthsFinder coach who helps you explore this. 

            <p><strong>Adaptability</strong> – I’m able to switch tasks easily and live in the moment. I do have plans, they’re just more fluid and I’m happy to modify or delay them if something else comes up. I don’t resent sudden requests or detours, and on some level look forward to them. I can respond willingly to the demands of the moment even if they pull me away from my own plans. I thrive off pressures that demand an immediate response (like a looming deadline). I love spontaneity, and dislike predictability.
                        
            <p><strong>Communication</strong> – I like to explain things to others, and am good at describing and writing. I’m not a massive fan of public speaking but can do it. I can turn events into engaging stories, and can take dry ideas and enliven them with images, examples, metaphors etc. I’m able to condense/summarise information, although there’s a danger of doing it too much, ie oversummarising or oversimplifying. 
                        
            <p><strong>Input</strong> – I collect and archive information and ideas. I’m inquisitive and like to see how things work. I collect things (not really physical stuff, more like stuff in my brain), find many things interesting, and I like to read, travel, and explore – ie soak up new experiences. I like to provide relevant and tangible help to others.
                        
            <p><strong>Intellection</strong> – I am introspective and reflective. I like to think, be challenged, and figure things out. Because of this I sometimes lack focus. I enjoy time alone to muse and think. I’m my own best companion. I like to pose myself questions and answer them - ‘mental hum’. I need time alone for reflection.
                        
            <p><strong>Learner</strong> – I have a strong desire to learn and continuously improve. I’m energised by the journey from ignorance to competence, the thrill of the first few facts, and feeling increasing confidence in the subject matter. I thrive in environments with short tasks and expectations to learn a lot about the new subject then move on to the next one. I don’t want to become the expert, or gain academic or professional credentials or accolades - the outcome of learning is less significant for me than the learning process itself.
                        
            <p>I actually found this exercise quite useful to reflect back on these and was surprised at the amount I was able to remember.

            <h2>Learning and Career Development</h2>

            <p><strong>Strengths</strong> - I like to learn, I can switch tasks easily, and I like collecting and summarising information. I get on well with others and communicate well. I’m reflective, excellent with deadlines and pressure, like problems and problem solving, and have good strategies for figuring things out.

            <p><strong>Limitations</strong> - I can get ‘blocked’ if I think something is boring or pointless. I can get distracted with more interesting things. I can put things off if they’re not due immediately. I can take a back seat socially, especially in new situations. I can over-simplify information, and can spend too much time tinkering or finding out more about something.

            <h2>Learning Journey</h2>

            <p><strong>Strength use</strong> - all of them – and the way they interact with each other is important too - eg I love to learn, input information (into my brain), have good intellection (ability to process information and summarise it), and communicate it to others.
                        
            <p><strong>Downside</strong> – I can easily go down a rabbit hole, and spend too much time learning about something interesting but not necessarily relevant.
                        
                        
            <h2>Tension</h2>
                        
            <p>I was a youth worker for 10 years, working with teenagers who can sometimes have a lot of resistance or tension. After working with young people in various stages of strife or anger, pretty much anything an adult can throw at me is a walk in the park. 
                        
            <p>I think the relationship you have with someone will ultimately decide how well you work together – if there’s tension while working on something then maybe it’d be a good idea to catch up socially, to check in on how things for that person are in their personal life, or just to spend time with them without the stresses of the project. Having a strong relationship with others makes resistance or tension easier to manage. It also makes it easier to be direct with someone if they’re being a bit of a dick. 
                        
            <p>In saying that though, sometimes people are just the way they are, and acceptance and understanding are important.
